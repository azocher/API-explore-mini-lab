# Researching API Documentation

You will be working in small groups for x15 minutes to answer the following question about your assigned reasearch API. 

1. What type of request do you have to make to this API to return data? 
2. What is an example of data that you can access via this API? And what format does this data return as?
3. What is an example of an app your group can think that would utilize this data?
4. Who runs and maintains this API (aka who is paying for the cost of maintaining it.)

*At the end of lab time one person from each group  will be presenting your findings to the rest of the class.*
